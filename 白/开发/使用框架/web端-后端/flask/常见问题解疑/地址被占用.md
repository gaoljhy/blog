`OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use`

可能是系统端口，`host`参数不正确，与之前的进程发生冲突

> You already have a process bound to the default port (8000).
> If you already ran the same module before, it is  most likely that process still bound to the port. Try and locate the other process first:

```bash
top | grep Python

kill 对应pid

```
